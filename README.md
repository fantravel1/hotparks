# HOTPARKS.COM — README (v1)
**The world’s greatest parks — ranked by vibe.**  
**Where the Earth shows off.**

HotParks is not a “best parks” website.

It is a **global park discovery engine** that ranks parks by one thing most travel sites ignore:

> **Does this place feel alive?**

This README defines the **non-negotiable philosophy, scoring systems, architecture, page templates, tone, and guardrails** for building HotParks into a mega-site.

---

## 0) The Core Reframe (Non-Negotiable)

### “Hot” means alive.

HotParks is not:
- most famous  
- largest  
- most visited  
- most “top 10”  

HotParks is:
- parks that feel alive  
- parks that hit emotionally  
- parks that stay in your memory  
- parks that create story  

“Hot” can mean:

- stunning  
- wild  
- culturally electric  
- surreal  
- beautiful  
- weird  
- cinematic  
- peaceful in a powerful way  

HotParks exists to say:

> **“This park is not just good. It’s unforgettable.”**

---

## 1) What HotParks Is (and Is Not)

### HotParks IS:
- a global directory of parks across all types  
- a ranking system based on vibe + awe + usability  
- a park intelligence tool (entrances, trails, timing, safety)  
- a list engine for evergreen SEO  
- a “parks near me” utility for everyday discovery  
- a high-trust global authority

### HotParks is NOT:
- a government park directory  
- a national parks-only site  
- a hiking bro site  
- a generic travel blog  
- a “largest parks” encyclopedia  
- a theme park directory  

If a page reads like a Wikipedia entry, it’s wrong.

---

## 2) The Signature IP: Park Heat Index (Core Product)

Every park receives three scores:

### A) HOT Score (1–100)
A composite score representing **how alive the park feels**.

### B) Wildness Score (1–10)
How much raw nature / wilderness energy the park carries.

### C) Ease Score (1–10)
How accessible and usable the park is for normal humans.

These three scores must always be shown together.

---

## 3) HOT Score (Canonical Factors)

HOT Score is derived from:

- **Scenery Intensity**
- **Wildlife / Nature Richness**
- **Uniqueness**
- **Accessibility**
- **Cleanliness**
- **Safety**
- **Crowd Energy**
- **Cultural Significance**
- **“You Will Remember This Forever” Factor**

### Philosophy
- A park can be wild but not “hot” (if it’s miserable or inaccessible).
- A park can be easy but not “hot” (if it’s forgettable).
- HOT Score is the intersection of:
  **awe + life + story + usability**.

---

## 4) HotParks Is Global (Not Just National Parks)

HotParks includes:

- national parks  
- city parks  
- historic parks  
- royal parks  
- volcanic parks  
- desert parks  
- rainforest parks  
- marine parks  
- safari parks  
- mountain parks  
- sculpture parks  
- theme-adjacent nature parks  

HotParks becomes:

> **The global map of outdoor greatness.**

---

## 5) The 4 Mega Categories (Core Architecture)

Every park belongs to one of these four top-level systems:

### 1) Wild Parks 🌲
Big landscapes, wildlife, raw nature.

### 2) City Parks 🌆
The world’s best urban nature and human gathering grounds.

### 3) Cultural Parks 🏛️
History, monuments, identity, meaning.

### 4) Water Parks (Real Nature) 🌊
Marine parks, lagoons, waterfalls, rivers, coastal reserves.

### Rule
A park must belong to **one** primary mega category.
It may have secondary tags, but the primary category is singular.

---

## 6) Park Vibe Filters (The Addictive Feature)

This is the UX moat.

People don’t choose parks by category.  
They choose parks by feeling.

**Canonical Vibe Filters:**

- Cinematic views  
- Quiet and sacred  
- Family paradise  
- Wildlife overload  
- Best sunrise

- **at least 3 vibe filters**

### F) Lists & Rankings

---

## 8) Canonical Park Page Template (Exact Order)

- Park name + country/city/region
- HOT Score (1–100)
- Wildness Score (1–10)
- Ease Score (1–10)

/itineraries/
```

---

## 12) The Wildcard: Parks That Aren’t Parks

This category makes HotParks modern.

Include:
- botanical gardens
- arboretums
- protected valleys
- scenic reserves
- UNESCO landscapes

Rule:
If it delivers “park energy,” it qualifies.

---

- parks visited
- parks planned
- parks bucket list
- HOT Score collected

Badges (examples):
- City Park Master

- Mountain Soul  

This is retention without turning into a video game.

---

- modern
- clean
- confident
- nature-forward
- cinematic
- not overly outdoorsy-bro
- not government-y

Preferred tone:
> “This place has energy. Here’s how to experience it properly.”

Avoid:
- sterile encyclopedia writing
- influencer hype
- corny spirituality
- macho wilderness talk

---

Eventually HotParks becomes:

---

## 18) The One Rule That Protects Everything

**HotParks only wins if the scoring stays honest.**

If a park is famous but dead-feeling, the site must say so.

If a park is obscure but magical, the site must elevate it.

That is the brand.  
That is the moat.  
That is why it becomes the authority.
