The Wildness Score (1-10) measures raw nature and wilderness energy. The Ease Score (1-10) measures how accessible and usable the park is.

                        <p>The parks with the highest "you will remember this forever" factor — a core component of the HOT Score. Torres del Paine, Zhangjiajie, Plitvice Lakes, and Fiordland consistently top the list. But some lesser-known parks like Durmitor in Montenegro or Chapada Diamantina in Brazil hit just as hard. It's not about fame. It's about the moment the landscape rewires your brain.</p>

                        <p>Cinematic parks are landscapes so visually overwhelming they look like movie sets. Filter by the "Cinematic Views" vibe to find 247 parks worldwide that deliver frame-worthy moments. Torres del Paine's granite spires, Banff's turquoise lakes, the Scottish Highlands' moody valleys, and Monument Valley's iconic buttes top the photography list.</p>

                        <p>Parks tagged with the "Quiet &amp; Sacred" vibe carry a spiritual weight that silence creates. Yakushima's ancient cedar forests in Japan, the Hoh Rainforest in Washington, Glendalough in Ireland, and lesser-known spots like Bialowieza Forest in Poland radiate this energy. These are parks for solo reflection — places where time moves differently.</p>

For sunset, chase Monument Valley, Santorini's caldera parks, Uluru in Australia, or the cliffs of Cinque Terre. HotParks tags parks specifically for "Best Sunrise" and "Best Sunset" vibes.</p>

                        <p>The Park Heat Index was built to answer this exact question. Sort by parks with Wildness Score 7+ and Ease Score 7+ to find the sweet spot. Plitvice Lakes (Wild 6, Ease 8), Manuel Antonio (Wild 7, Ease 9), and Banff (Wild 8, Ease 8) are the gold standard — seriously wild parks that don't require survival skills to enjoy.</p>
